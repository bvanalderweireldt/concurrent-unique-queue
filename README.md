# concurrent-unique-queue
A Java concurrent unique queue backed by a Set (LinkedHashSet), for when you need to have a Queue with unique elements. 
The ConcurrentSetBlockingQueue will behave the same way if the queue is full or if a duplicate entry already exists in the Queue.

**Your element needs to have a proper hash and equals implementations !**
